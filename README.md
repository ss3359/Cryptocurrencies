# Cryptocurrencies

# Overview 

In this analysis, unsupervised learning is applied to process data, how to cluster data, and reducing dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using Princpal Component Analysis (PCA). In this analysis, data is acquired from various Cryptocurrency businesses. One such accounting firm is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its customers. However, the company is lost in the universe of cryptocurrencies. Τherefore, a report is created describing various cryptocurrencies in the trading market and how they are grouped to create a system for this big investment.  The algorithm best used tο show if this is a worthy investment are clustering algorithms. The first part is preprocessing the data for PCA. Second, data dimensions are reduced using PCA. Third, K-means is applied to cluster distinct cyptocurrencies. Finally, we display the results on a 3-dimensional graph. The file which this analaysis is conducted is called crypto_clustering.ipynb.
